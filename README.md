Project Objectives:
Develop a functional and visually appealing calculator. Provide a responsive user interface for real-time input and calculation. Ensure robust error handling for invalid operations such as division by zero or invalid input. Demonstrate proficiency in Java programming and GUI design using Swing.

Key Activities:
1.GUI Design: Created a main frame with a layout for a text field and buttons. Designed a grid layout for button placement with uniform spacing and size. 
2.Functionality Implementation: Implemented event-driven programming to capture button clicks. Developed logic for arithmetic operations and error handling. 
3.Error Handling: Handled cases like division by zero and invalid number formatting gracefully.
4.Testing: Tested the application for various input scenarios to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Technology Used:
1.Programming Language: Java For core logic implementation and event handling. 
2.Swing Library: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI). 
3.AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit): Utilized in combination with Swing for managing GUI components.
